# relation_extraction
This repository is created for the purpose of Automated Relation Extraction among Brain Regions which is extended with a case study of Paraventricular Nucleus of Thalamus and its connectivity graph.  

Supplementary Data Guideline : 
All the supplementary data including brain region dictionary, annotated sentences, connectivity graphs and figures can be found under /PVTResearch/supplementary folder

Following files are provided :
- "Annotations and PMIDs of Annotated Papers" : Includes annotated sentences from 14 PVT related publications. It contains 322 annotated sentences. (Loc: ../supplementary/)
- "PVT-Direction Annotated" : Includes annotated directions for correctly extracted relations. For PVT Corpus 122 annotated direction can be found. (Loc: ../supplementary/)
- "WhiteText - Direction Annotated" : Includes annotated directions for correctly extracted relations. For WhiteText Corpus 277 annotated direction can be found.  (Loc: ../supplementary/)
- "Brain Region Dictionary" : A dictionary of brain region entities can be found in this file. (Loc: ../supplementary/)
- "patterns" : List of patterns that are used in this study. (Loc: ../supplementary/patterns)
- "regexOfPatterns" : Each pattern has been represented with a regular expression in our study. The list of regexes can be found. (Loc: ../supplementary/patterns)
- PMIDs of used corpora : PMIDs for full text, abstract and annotated papers of PVT Corpus can be found. (Loc: ../supplementary/corpus)
- Graph images : All connectivity graphs of the study can be found under this folder. (Loc: ../supplementary/connectivityGraphs)
